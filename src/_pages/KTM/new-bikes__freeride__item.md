## We don't just build replicas, we build factory editions

Championship winning bikes, like this one. Thanks to its compact SOHC (single overhead camshaft) engine delivering explosive but controllable power, it is the weapon of choice for our Factory Teams around the world. Experts will notice its revolutionary WP AER 48 forks, the anodized triple clamps and sprocket, its upgraded Akrapovič muffler, the orange frame or the D.I.D DirtStar rims. The rest will only see a blur blasting past. Is it Ryan Dungey? Possibly. Or it could be you.
